# FDS
# Customer Purchase Data Analysis
# Overview
This repository contains a Python script and an Excel dataset for analyzing customer purchase behavior using probability, statistical calculations, and data visualization. The analysis includes probability calculations, expected value computations, joint and conditional probabilities, and trend visualizations.

# Files Included
ðŸ“‚ customer_data1.xlsx â€“ The dataset containing customer transactions.
ðŸ“œ Sambhav_FDS_Assignment1.py â€“ The Python script used for analysis.
ðŸ“Š Figures/ â€“ Contains all the generated visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, box plots, etc.).

## Analysis Performed
# Basic Probability Calculation
Computes the probability of purchasing each product category.

# Expected Purchase Amount
Calculates the expected value of customer spending.

# Joint Probability & Conditional Probability
Examines the relationship between product categories and payment methods.

# Trend Analysis & Visualizations
